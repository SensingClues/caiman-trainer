# caiman-trainer

This project is part of the cAIman suite for image classification.

The cAIman suite is basically an ML-ops platform to monitor and maintain your image classifiers used to detect species on wildlife camera traps.

## cAIman trainer

CAIman trainer holds the jypyter nortebooks to (re) train your already deployed models and train them to improve based on the most information rich images in the database.

For more details on the whole CAIman ML-ops stack have a look at that repository.
